# CS253 HW10
## will Trudy be able to see original contents of datagram? How about source, dest IP address, transport protocol, application port?
Original contents of datagram/source and dest IP address: Unable since they are encrypted with unknown keys.
Transport protocol and application port: Able since they are written in the TCP protocol directly.

## flip bits without detection?
No since receiver can check it by MAC.

## masquerade as R1 using R1â€™s IP address?
No since Trudy doesn't have keys so the encrypted payload will be ignored by the receiver.

## replay a datagram?
No since we have IPSec sequence number.
