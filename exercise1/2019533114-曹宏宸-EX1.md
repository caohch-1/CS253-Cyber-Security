# Exercise1
## Formulate the optimization problem
$$
minimize\qquad \beta||x_t-x_0||+(1-\beta)||y_t-y_0|| \\
subject\quad to\qquad ||x_t-x_0||<\epsilon
$$
where  the label $y_t$ denotes the target label, $0 \leq \beta \leq 1$ controls the relative importance of the perturbation and the objective function, and $\epsilon$ is a constant measuring closeness.
